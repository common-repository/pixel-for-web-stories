**But Web Stories are a subsect of the AMP framework**.

Meaning that, while AMP stories (Accelerated Mobile Pages stories) now called Web Stories are similar to generic HTML pages, the AMP framework clears away any custom JavaScript, the majority of CSS styling, Widgets and Plugins (including ¬†scripts/tracking codes), thus making pages and posts load almost instantly.

That is why you must (re)add your tracking codes (Google, Facebook, Twitter, ...) to track your audience and capture the actions people take when they interact with your Web Stories.
